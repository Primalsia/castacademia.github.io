Hello and thanks for viewing my project!

I recreated the Khan Academy landing page as an assignment with 100 Devs! I added my own little flair to it while still maintaining the design and structure the original Khan Academy has. Getting the navigation bar and playing around with flex boxes was the struggle, but through trial and error and an occassional cup of coffee, I'm proud to say I did it! I'll be coming back and adding more interactivity with JavaScript...
